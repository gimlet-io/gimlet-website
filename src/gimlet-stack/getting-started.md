# Getting Started

Bootstrap curated Kubernetes stacks!

Logging, metrics, ingress and more - all delivered with gitops.

- You can install logging aggregators, metric collectors, ingress controllers and more on your cluster with a few commands, 
without much knowledge of Helm charts, and their configuration options

- The components are delivered through a plain git repository with self-contained gitops automation

- You will get constant upgrades for the installed components from the stack curators
