# Getting Started

Welcome!

GimletD is the GitOps release manager.

It builds on the concepts, conventions and workflows that Gimlet CLI introduced 
and extends it with a centralized approach for managing releases.

It also packs all release automation logic that used to be scattered in CI pipelines.

Read the [concepts](/gimletd/concepts) behind GimletD and its role alongside Gimlet CLI.
