# Scaling gitops

Now that you reached this page, you have a fairly good understanding of OneChart, 
the Gimlet environment file and Gimlet CLI's many feature.

To scale Gimlet CLI's concepts we made GimletD, 
a server-side component to provide a centralized approach to scale them.

## GimletD is the GitOps release manager

It builds on the concepts, conventions and workflows that Gimlet CLI introduced and extends it with a centralized approach for managing releases.

It also packs all release automation logic that used to be scattered in CI pipelines.

Read the [concepts behind GimletD](/gimletd/concepts) and its role alongside Gimlet CLI.


Thank you for the re-shares Laszlo Reszegi and Lars Krieger.

If any of you likers would re-share my post, it would really go a long way. Either way, thanks for your support!
