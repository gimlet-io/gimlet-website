# Welcome to the Gimlet universe!

Gimlet is a set of tools that will get you an application operations platform on top of Kubernetes.

It is built on the de-fact tools of the ecosystem - Helm and Flux - and provides you with a golden-path, a set of best -practices so you can focus on your task at hand. Not having to navigate the vast options the cloud native ecosystem has to offer you.

### Where to start
- **Concepts** discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation when you are starting out.

- **Tutorials** take you through a series of steps to deploy your application on Kubernetes. Start here if youâ€™re new to Gimlet or the Kubernetes ecosystem

- **How-to guides** are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Gimlet works.

- **Reference** guides contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of Gimlet's machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
