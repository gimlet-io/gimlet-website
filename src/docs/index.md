# Welcome to the Gimlet universe!

Gimlet is a set of tools that will get you a developer platform on top of Kubernetes.

It is built on the de-facto tools of the ecosystem - Helm and Flux - and provides you with a golden-path, a set of best-practices, so you can focus on your task at hand. Without having to navigate the vast options the cloud native ecosystem offers you.

### Where to start
- **Concepts** discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation when you are starting out.

Start with getting a high level overview of [Gimlet Components](/concepts/components), then go deeper if you need the motivation and approach of each component: [Stack](/concepts/gimlet-stack-concepts), [GimletD](/concepts/gimletd-concepts) or [Onechart](/concepts/onechart-concepts).


- **Tutorials** take you through a series of steps to deploy your application on Kubernetes. Start here if youâ€™re new to Gimlet or the Kubernetes ecosystem

If you are a developer, start with [Deploy your app to Kubernetes without the boilerplate](/docs/deploy-your-app-to-kubernetes-without-the-boilerplate/). If you are a cluster admin, start with [Make Kubernetes an application platform with Gimlet Stack](/docs/make-kubernetes-an-application-platform-with-gimlet-stack/)

- **Guides** are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Gimlet works.

- **Reference** guides contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of Gimlet's machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
